**Comments:**

`TableID` represents one of the tables at the restaurant, and it's meant to keep track of how many should be rendered for the restaurant view.

`TableInstanceID` represents an instance of that table, when it is currently being occupied (checkInTime==not null, checkOutTime==null). It has attributes, such as an assigned waiter, and has an order linked to it. This object will be archived for statistics and/or bookeeping purposes. All orders will reference one `TableInstanceID`.

## Get started
```
npm run setup
npm run start
